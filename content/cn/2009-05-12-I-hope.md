It's hoped that I can do something for my great motherland.

But the only thing I can do now is to be rational, to play my role well and to pray for the victims.

The earthquake has no mercy, but we Chinese do.

Whenever, wherever, we are together, fighting against the natural disaster.

Once the Chinese are united, miracle happens.
